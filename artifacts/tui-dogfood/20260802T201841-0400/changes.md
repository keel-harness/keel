# Changes implemented

No Keel behavior changes yet. Implementation is gated on observed evidence, a failing
test, and the public epic-plan requirement.

## External workload — validated local-only feature

- Commit `941ab66 feat(termui): accept PathLike filenames in edit`.
- Changed `src/click/termui.py`, `tests/test_termui.py`, and `CHANGES.md`.
- Red evidence: single-Path test failed with `TypeError: 'PosixPath' object is not iterable` before
  implementation; iterable case passed incidentally through `subprocess.Popen`.
- Green evidence: focused `2 passed, 244 deselected`; full termui `223 passed, 23 skipped`.
- Static checks: ruff/mypy/pyright **NOT_RUN** because unavailable.

## External workload — validated local-only bug fix

- Commit `21a08e3 fix(termui): flush buffered progress on exit`.
- Changed `src/click/_termui_impl.py`, `tests/test_termui.py`, and `CHANGES.md`.
- First red: stale final progress rendered `14/20`; first green reached `20/20`.
- Adversarial red: the initial patch incorrectly marked an incomplete bar finished at `pos=7`.
- Final implementation flushes pending intervals and renders once, relying on `make_step()` to mark
  only a genuinely complete bar finished.
- Final Keel-run checks: focused `2 passed`; progress subset `39 passed, 209 deselected`; full
  termui `225 passed, 23 skipped`. Operator post-style focused rerun: `2 passed`.
- Static checks: ruff/mypy/pyright **NOT_RUN** because unavailable.

## External workload — validated local-only refactor

- Commit `edda51f refactor(termui): normalize edit filenames at boundary`.
- Changed `src/click/_termui_impl.py`, `src/click/termui.py`, and `tests/test_termui.py`.
- `Editor.edit_files` now performs inline `os.fspath` normalization immediately before subprocess
  invocation; `click.edit` retains only scalar-versus-iterable dispatch.
- Two PathLike cases were consolidated into the existing parameterized subprocess-boundary test
  after review removed 37 lines of duplicated standalone tests.
- Final Keel-run checks: editor normalization `16 passed`; PathLike `2 passed`; full termui `227
  passed, 23 skipped`. The immediately preceding implementation run also had progress `39 passed`.
- Static checks: ruff/mypy/pyright **NOT_RUN** because unavailable.
